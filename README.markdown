# Random Quote Machine 2

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/massivemike8/pen/WNroRoo](https://codepen.io/massivemike8/pen/WNroRoo).

The random quote machine is an application I developed using React. Users can generate a random quote by clicking a button and then tweet about it after.
***
### Why the project is useful
This application firstly stores its quotes in an array, and then uses a math.random function to generate its quotes when the button is clicked.
***
### How you can get started with the project
freeCodeCamp offers great resources which helped me get started, and the random quote machine forms one of the neccessary projects to complete in the Front End Libraries.

### Where you can get help with the project
Help for completing the project is provided on YouTube by Dylan Israel and Florin Pop, through their respective channels.

### Who maintains and contributes to the project
I maintain the project by updating the design and improving on its interactivity.
